#  Movie Rating Prediction   

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to build a predictive model for estimating movie ratings based on various attributes like genre, director, and cast. The model is trained on the [IMDB India Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies) and evaluated using standard regression metrics.

## **Objective**  
The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts movie ratings based on available metadata, improving recommendation systems and user experiences.

---

## **Dataset**  
The dataset used for training and testing can be downloaded from:  
[IMDB India Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)  

### **Dataset Features**  
- **Title**: Name of the movie  
- **Genre**: Movie genre (Action, Drama, etc.)  
- **Director**: Name of the director  
- **Cast**: List of main actors  
- **Year**: Release year  
- **Duration**: Movie duration in minutes  
- **Rating**: IMDb rating (Target Variable)  

---

## **Approach**  
1. **Data Collection & Exploration**  
   - Load and analyze dataset structure.  
   - Identify and handle missing values.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoding categorical variables.  
   - Filling missing values with appropriate methods.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Compute **director success rate** (average rating of movies by the same director).  
   - Compute **average rating of similar genres** to capture trends.  

4. **Model Training & Selection**  
   - Train multiple regression models:  
     - Linear Regression  
     - Random Forest Regressor  
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate using **MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score**.  

---

## **Data Preprocessing**  
### **Handling Missing Values**  
- Numerical missing values were filled with the **median**.  
- Categorical missing values were handled using **mode imputation** or dropped if necessary.  

### **Encoding Categorical Variables**  
- Used **Label Encoding** for categorical variables (`genre`, `director`, `cast`).  

---

## **Feature Engineering**  
To improve model accuracy, we engineered additional features:  
- **Director Success Rate**: The average rating of movies directed by the same person.  
- **Genre Average Rating**: The mean rating of all movies in the same genre.  

```python
df['director_success_rate'] = df.groupby('director')['rating'].transform('mean')
df['genre_avg_rating'] = df.groupby('genre')['rating'].transform('mean')
```

---

## **Model Training & Evaluation**  
### **Model Used: Random Forest Regressor**  
Random Forest was chosen for its ability to handle categorical variables and its robustness against overfitting.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### **Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures average prediction error.  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Penalizes larger errors.  
- **RÂ² Score**: Measures how well the model explains variance in ratings.  

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score

mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"MAE: {mae}, RMSE: {rmse}, RÂ²: {r2}")
```

---

## **Results**  
| Model  | MAE  | RMSE  | RÂ² Score |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| Random Forest | 0.57 | 0.83 | 0.79 |

The **Random Forest Regressor** performed the best, achieving **0.79 RÂ² score**, meaning it explains 79% of the variance in movie ratings.
